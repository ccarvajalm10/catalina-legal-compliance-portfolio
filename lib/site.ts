    title:
      "From Regulation to Workflow: A Framework for Responsible AI Implementation in Legal Operations and Compliance Functions",
    degree: "MSc in Law, Data and AI (EMILDAI)",
    argument:
      "Responsible AI in legal and compliance work is achieved not through isolated technical features but by building governance mechanisms into the workflow itself: retrieval grounding, an encoded playbook, an evaluator loop, a human approval gate, and an audit trail.",
    note:
      "Each case study here is an illustrative implementation of that framework, assessed against the external legal requirements it targets rather than against internally defined success criteria.",

    bio: "Legal and compliance specialist focused on AI governance, data protection and information-security control frameworks. Completing an MSc in Law, Data and AI (EMILDAI) with a specialisation in Cybersecurity at Universidad de León and AI Ethics at Università di Pisa. CIPM and CIPP/E certified.",
    background:
      "My background is multidisciplinary across technology, data and law. Before moving into Law, Data and AI, I worked in a compliance team at a law firm in Colombia, where much of the work was manual review of organisations and contracts against control frameworks and statutory requirements. This portfolio grew out of my Master's thesis, From Regulation to Workflow, and puts its framework into practice on three real processes.",
