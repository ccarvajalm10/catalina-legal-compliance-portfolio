          <h2>What the process is</h2>
          <p>
            Before an organisation can be certified to ISO/IEC 27001:2022, someone has to
            form a defensible view on every one of the 93 Annex&nbsp;A controls. For each
            control the question is the same: is it <strong>implemented</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>partially implemented</strong>, <strong>not implemented</strong>, or{" "}
            <strong>legitimately out of scope</strong>, and what in the organisation&rsquo;s
            own documents is the evidence either way. The result is a gap register that
            drives the remediation plan, plus a Statement of Applicability that records a
            decision on all 93 controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            The raw material is the organisation&rsquo;s ISMS documentation: roughly a dozen
            policies, plus whatever operational evidence exists. The assessor reads all of
            it and maps it, control by control, to the Annex&nbsp;A intent.
          </p>

          <h2>The problem</h2>
          <p>
            Done from scratch for an organisation this size, a first gap analysis is roughly{" "}
            <strong>four analyst-days</strong>. You read every document, hold the 93 control
            intents in your head, decide which sentences bear on each control, write a
            verdict and a rationale, and start a remediation list. It is slow, the line
            between <em>implemented</em> and <em>partially implemented</em> drifts as
            concentration fades, and the finished spreadsheet rarely records which sentence
            justified each verdict.
          </p>

          <h2>The AI angle: what I changed</h2>
          <p>
            I built a pipeline that does the <strong>first pass</strong>. It reads the whole
            document set once and, working through the controls in themed batches, drafts a
            verdict for each one under strict rules: an <em>implemented</em> or{" "}
            <em>partial</em> verdict must quote a specific supplied sentence, no quote means
            it cannot pass, every partial or gap must carry one concrete remediation action,
            and a confidence score is stated per verdict. The response is then validated in
            code, not trusted as-is.

          <h2>How the time figures are derived</h2>
          <p>
            These figures are <strong>demonstrative, not measured</strong>. They describe
            this build running on one fixed sample company. There is no deployment behind
            them and no empirical validation; the &ldquo;about four analyst-days&rdquo;
            baseline is an effort estimate, not a stopwatch reading.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Model pass:</strong> about 3 to 5 minutes of compute for all 93
              controls across the themed batches; a few cents to low single-digit dollars per
              run.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Analyst review:</strong> about 5 to 6 hours to check every verdict
              against its citation, adjust the boundary calls, and firm up the remediation
              wording.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Packaging:</strong> exports are generated automatically; about 30
              minutes to tidy the Statement of Applicability draft and the backlog.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The honest saving is in the authoring, not the judgement. The reviewer still
            makes every final call; they start from a cited draft instead of a blank page.
          </p>

          <h2>Results on the sample company</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>
                {s.met} implemented, {s.partial} partial, {s.gap} gap, {s.notApplicable} not
                applicable
              </strong>{" "}
              across the 93 controls; weighted coverage <strong>{s.coverageScore}/100</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every non-gap verdict carries a verbatim quote from a named document, so a
              check is a lookup rather than a re-read.
            </li>
            <li>
              The remediation backlog surfaced the real blockers to certification: untested
              backup restoration, an overdue penetration test, an unapproved supplier policy,
              no internal audit yet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accuracy is reported against a 30-control hand-labelled gold set on every
              change, with per-verdict precision and recall, a confusion matrix, and a full
              list of every miss (see <code>evals/</code> in the repository).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Where it is weak</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Partial versus implemented boundary calls.</strong> When a control is
              documented but evidence of <em>operation</em> is thin, the model and a human
              can reasonably disagree. This is the largest error class.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not Applicable needs a human.</strong> The model proposes exclusions;
              an assessor accepts each one and records the justification in the SoA.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It only sees what it is given.</strong> A polished policy with no
              operating evidence can read as implemented; the evidence register must be fed
              alongside the policies.
            </li>
          </ul>
